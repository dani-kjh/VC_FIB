# VC_FIB

On this repository you can find all of my work on the laboratory sessions of [Visi√≥ per Computadors](https://www.fib.upc.edu/ca/estudis/graus/grau-en-enginyeria-informatica/pla-destudis/assignatures/VC), during 2020/2021 Q2.

Each session contains a pdf with my report, a .docx with the original statement of that session and all of the code I wrote.
